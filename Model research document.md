## Project Title: Development of Interactive Cyber Threat Visualization Dashboard

---

## 1. Introduction

Modern organizations face an increasing number of cyber threats, making it difficult to analyze large volumes of security data using traditional methods. This project proposes an **Interactive Cyber Threat Visualization Dashboard** that converts raw security incident data into meaningful visual insights. The system enables analysts to quickly understand threat patterns, trends, and high-risk areas, supporting proactive cybersecurity decision-making.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Cybersecurity data is often complex, unstructured, and scattered across multiple sources such as attack logs and vulnerability feeds. The absence of an integrated and interactive visualization platform makes it challenging to identify trends, anomalies, and critical vulnerabilities efficiently.

---

## 3. Objectives of the Project

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To design a data-driven dashboard that provides real-time visual insights into cyber threats  
- To identify attack trends, anomalies, and high-risk periods using time-series analysis  
- To visualize geographical origins and targets of cyber incidents  
- To prioritize vulnerabilities and attack techniques using hierarchical visual models  
- To support informed decision-making through executive-ready security reports

## 4. Proposed System Overview

The proposed system follows a modular architecture where each component handles a specific stage of the data analytics pipeline. The system is implemented entirely using Python-based technologies to ensure flexibility, scalability, and integration with advanced data analytics libraries.

### System Workflow
- Data acquisition from security datasets  
- Data cleaning and normalization  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Visualization and pattern detection  
- Dashboard integration and user interaction
